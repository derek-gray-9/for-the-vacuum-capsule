# for-the-vacuum-capsule
For The Vacuum Capsule mod for Warhammer 40k: Darktide

## Installation
Copy the `ForTheVacuumCapsule` folder and all contents into your mod folder.
Add ForTheVacuumCapsule to your `mod_load_order.txt` file in that mod folder.

Your mod folder should be located somewhere like so:
`C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Warhammer 40,000 DARKTIDE\mods`

## Dependencies
If the mod folder is missing, you most likely have not installed the mod framework and mod loader. Those two mods are the basis for all Darktide mods. See the below links for installation instructions for those below.
