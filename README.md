# for-the-vacuum-capsule

For The Vacuum Capsule mod for Warhammer 40k: Darktide

## Features

### Tagging Wheel Customization

You can assign any voice line you would like to any position on the tagging wheel, rearranging it how you like.

### Missing/Hidden Voice Lines

Some voice lines, such as "yes" and "no", are not available in the base game. This mod allows you to use them, as well as the voice lines used when tagging any item in the game, such as "ammo" and the eponymous "vacuum capsule".

### Hotkeys

Instead of using the tagging wheel, you can bind hotkeys for each of the voice lines to fit more than 8, and for fast access while playing.

## Installation

Copy the `ForTheVacuumCapsule` folder and all contents into your mod folder.
Add ForTheVacuumCapsule to your `mod_load_order.txt` file in that mod folder.

Your mod folder should be located somewhere like so:
`C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Warhammer 40,000 DARKTIDE\mods`

## Dependencies

If the mod folder is missing, you most likely have not installed the mod framework and mod loader. Those two mods are the basis for all Darktide mods. See the below links for installation instructions for those below.
